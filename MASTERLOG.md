## Thu 22 Jan - Fri 23 Jan
Meeting with OS: Overall: 
- Phase I: Exploring / analyzing the HDBR dataset by Lindsay 2016 of normal developing brain samples --> benchmark / reference transcriptomic signatures for each step of the brain development (early embryonic?) of each brain compartment (sounds ambitious)
- Phase 2: Analyzing Ludovica's celebellar organoids ie mapping to the phase I dataset
So for the second step to be good the first step should be good, hope so.

Data is ready, QC and alignment by Loic, will need to ask for QC reports and alignment reports to see them myself.

2 streams of analyses are DEGs and AS. Loic will handle AS mostly? Will confirm later with OS.

Phase I:
- Analyze at the highest level first: mid, hind, fore --> stratify further if needed
- 2 QC steps from the perspective of the dataset: (1) reproduce the PCA in the HDBR paper (2)
